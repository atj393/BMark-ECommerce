## Code Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **camelCase** for variables and functions: `myVariable`, `fetchUserData()`.
- **PascalCase** for components: `UserProfile`, `ProductCard`.
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants: `MAX_RETRIES`.

### Code Style
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use ES6 features, async/await, and consistent coding style.
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks whenever possible.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in `.env.local` files to keep secrets safe.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new features or modifications whenever possible.
- Use meaningful test descriptions to make it clear what each test does.
